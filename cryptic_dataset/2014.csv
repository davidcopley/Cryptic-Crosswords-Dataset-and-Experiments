25 Interval with money invested in annuity scheme (7)," TONTINE TIN [money] invested in TONE [musical interval] This word immediately rang bells as one that had particular significance in one of Agatha Christie’s novels, read many years ago.

I had a feeling that Miss Marple woke up with this word popping into her head [as they do] but I was quite delighted to find that she was actually doing a crossword when it occurred to her! “I wish I had a dictionary here. Tontine and Tokay – I always mix those two words up. One, I believe, is a Hungarian wine.” Wikipedia: ‘A tontine is an investment plan for raising capital, devised in the 17th century and relatively widespread in the 18th and 19th centuries. It combines features of a group annuity and a lottery. Each subscriber pays an agreed sum into the fund, and thereafter receives an annuity. As members die, their shares devolve to the other participants, and so the value of each annuity increases. On the death of the last member, the scheme is wound up. In a variant, which has provided the plot device for most fictional versions, upon the death of the penultimate member the capital passes to the last survivor.’ I found that this is also the theme for a film called ‘The Wrong Box’, which I think I shall have to seek out, as it sounds like a lot of fun [anything with Peter Cook and Dudley Moore has to be good value, for me]. Please forgive the digression. 😉 ",1496
