I don’t like lamb; but mutton dressed like lamb!’.” The answer refers not to the current English prince, but Charles Stuart, Bonnie Prince Charlie, of “The Skye Boat Song” fame.

"16. Decaying star in dock after recorded statement (3,5)"," RED DWARF A homophone (‘statement’) of READ WHARF (‘dock after recorded’; READ for ‘recorded’ is something of a stretch). The definition is also a little questionable: a red dwarf is a quite happy little star, decaying only in the sense that like any star it is burning its hydrogen fuel, and will eventually run out (although the universe is too young for this to have happened yet to a red dwarf).

Here ‘formation’ may have either sense: in archaic use, a nebula might be a distant galaxy (formation – structure) or, more currently, a stellar nursery (formation – creation); but a nebula – the famous Crab Nebula for example – may also be the remains of a stellar explosion, not a ‘formation of stars’ in any sense.
