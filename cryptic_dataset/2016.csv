21 REDUCTIONS Point of sale? (10)," Cryptic definition. I presume the idea here is that shops put on what we call “sales” that involve price reductions.

Surely the direct point of a sale is either to clear out merchandisethat is not moving or to draw in customers; reductions are more of an indirect point ",474
