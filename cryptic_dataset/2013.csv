26 People about to see fruit (5)," MELON : MEN(people, strictly speaking about half of them – in the singular form “man” could refer to people without regard to sex, but I don’t think the same true of the plural “men”) containing(about) LO(see! as in “lo and behold!”). Down ",241

Answer: Torquato or perhaps his lesser known father, both poets and compatriots but not contemporaries of Italian poet Dante, or Durante degli Alighieri. With the checking letters T_S_O, I was wondering if this was an allusion to (horse)meat burgers.

1 SNATCH Pluck shown in American kidnapping (6),   Double definition   ‘American’ is there because the word ‘snatch’ is probably more used by Americans than Brits when it comes to napping kids.    ,149
4 EARWIG Girl from near Wigan – a sixfooter (6),"   [n]EAR WIG[an] – with Nan being the girl taken ‘from’ it   This could have been just a hidden solution, but Dante wants us to remove a girl called Nan. It’s mainly an American name (think of the famous opera singer Nan Merriman), very familiar to Chinese too. Not sure about people in the UK. Wikipedia says that it is short for Anna or Agnes.    ",350
8 BOYCOTT He earned a name for exclusive treatment in Ireland (7),"   Double definition, perhaps   I could find the solution only after changing 1d from ‘space’ into ‘scope’. The ‘exclusive treatment’ (BOYCOTT) is named after an Irish land agent (Cpt Charles C Boycott (1832-1897)) who had a conflict with the Irish Land League.    ",265

1 SCOPE Room with a view? (5),"   Double definition   Initially, I was pretty sure that this had to be ‘space’. I think it can be justified when seeing the second part of the clue as being cryptic – more space etc. Yes, SCOPE is much better after I saw the ‘view’ bit. SCOPE can mean ‘to scan’ as a verb and it is short for eg ‘microscope’, ie ‘something with a view’ (question mark).    ",357
2 ARCHERS They draw back before going for gold (7),"   Cryptic definition   This one took a while to fall in place. It was clear that it had to be ‘archers’ but I think ‘going for gold’ is a bit unfortunate within the context. Perhaps, it’s me missing something. By the way, I am really scared of this kind of weapon / sports gear. Perhaps, because one can see the lethal arrow coming one’s way.    ",347
